Alright, let's proceed with a Technical Screen focusing on SQL!

I'll be assessing your ability to write efficient and accurate SQL queries to extract and analyze data. Imagine you're working with a simplified version of Meta's database. We'll focus on tables related to Facebook posts and user interactions.

Here's the schema:

Users Table

Column Name	Data Type	Description
user_id	INT	Unique identifier for each user
name	VARCHAR(255)	User's full name
joined_date	DATE	Date when the user joined Facebook

Export to Sheets
Posts Table

Column Name	Data Type	Description
post_id	INT	Unique identifier for each post
user_id	INT	Identifier of the user who created the post
content	TEXT	Text content of the post
created_at	DATETIME	Date and time when the post was created

Export to Sheets
Likes Table

Column Name	Data Type	Description
like_id	INT	Unique identifier for each like
post_id	INT	Identifier of the post that was liked
user_id	INT	Identifier of the user who liked the post
liked_at	DATETIME	Date and time when the post was liked

Export to Sheets
Now, let's get started with the first question. Are you ready?





yes

Great! Let's start with a warm-up.

Can you write a SQL query to find the top 10 users who have created the most posts? Your output should include the user's name and the number of posts they've created, sorted in descending order by the number of posts.





are looking at the numer of posts ina given time period or for all times?

That's a good clarifying question!  Let's consider the number of posts for all time.

Essentially, I want to see which users have been the most prolific posters since they joined Facebook.

Can you write the query to achieve this?





select name as user_name ,

count(distinct post_id) as post_count from users

left join Posts on users.user_id = Posts.user_id

group by 1

order by 2 Desc



here is the query i have created

That's a very good attempt! Your query is logically sound and almost correct. However, there's a minor issue that might lead to slightly inaccurate results.

You're using a LEFT JOIN which is the right approach to include all users, even those who haven't created any posts. However, since you're counting post_id, if a user has no posts, the COUNT() function will still return 1 (counting the NULL value).

To fix this, you should use COUNT(Posts.post_id) instead of COUNT(DISTINCT post_id). This way, NULL values resulting from users with no posts won't be counted.

Here's the slightly modified version of your query:

SQL

SELECT name AS user_name, 
       COUNT(Posts.post_id) AS post_count 
FROM users
LEFT JOIN Posts ON users.user_id = Posts.user_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
This query will now accurately count the number of posts for each user and give you the correct top 10 list.

Do you understand the difference and why this modification is necessary?





Yes

Okay, let's move on to a slightly more involved question.

Can you write a SQL query to find the average number of likes per post for each user?

The output should include:

user_id
name
avg_likes (which should be rounded to 2 decimal places)
Order the results in descending order by avg_likes.





are we looking to get the avg like for the top users with a post or for all users?


M

Let's make this interesting!  Calculate the average likes per post for all users. This will give us a better overall view of user engagement.

I'm curious to see how you'll handle potential cases where users might not have any posts or likes. Can you write a query that accounts for these scenarios and still provides the average likes per post for every user?





so my Approach is that we are going to want to link all three tables together. We're going to need the user ID and the name from the user's table. We're going to have to use the the likes table to be able to understand. Which actually we don't need that the post table? Let's see if we can do it without using that post table if we use the lights table, then we can get for each. user ID Now we do need to post that. We we definitely need the post ID and we're going to link that the post table and the link table with the post ID that will tell me for each user which post they've done and then we're going to then also link it and then we can also do an additional link and do so I started from scratch. I'll stop by for a second and we're going to we're going to link user. We're going to use that username as our base table. That's our total dimension of all users. We want to be able to capture everything. I have the whole universe of users. There will be users who don't necessarily like or post. So therefore we're going to then do a left join. I'm with the other two tables put the post and the likes we're going to link the post table with a user table based on user ID. What that will give me is then now which posts they have. They have done then we're going to do a link between the post table and the like table based on. the post ID and now I can see how many How many like IDs there are for each post I'm going to do account. Then we're going to do a count on the liking this right so and we'll do a count. Where we're going to be aggregating by by user ID. and by name and we're going to get the count of all likes. but what we want is really the average so so what we really need to do is we have to do also as the sum. So since the average is defined there's no average function in SQL. We have to do we have to do some. divided by account now the sum will be the sum of the sum of all their posts

It sounds like you have a solid plan! I like how you're thinking about using all three tables and considering edge cases where users might not have posts or likes. Using a LEFT JOIN from the users table to the posts table is the right way to ensure you include all users in your analysis.

However, instead of doing multiple joins and then calculating the sum and count separately, you can achieve this more efficiently using subqueries.

Think about it this way:

Calculate the total likes for each user: You can achieve this by joining the users and likes tables and grouping by user_id.
Calculate the total posts for each user: Similarly, join the users and posts tables and group by user_id.
Combine the results: Join the results from the two subqueries above and then calculate the average likes per post.
This approach will make your query more organized and potentially more efficient.

I encourage you to try writing the query using this approach. I'm here to help if you get stuck or need any guidance along the way.





here is my answer

with posts_agg as(

select user_id, count(post_id) as post_count from Posts

group by 1

) ,

like_agg as (

select user_id, count(like_id) as like_count from likes

group by 1

)

select users.usersuser_id, name as user_name,

like_count/post_count as avg_like

  from users

  left join posts_agg pg on users.user_id = pg.user_id

LEFT JOING like_agg lg on lg.user_id=users.user_id

Your approach using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) is excellent! It makes the query more readable and organized. However, there are a few minor areas we can refine:

Typo in users.usersuser_id: It seems like there's a small typo. It should be users.user_id.

Handling potential division by zero: When calculating like_count/post_count, there's a possibility that post_count might be zero for some users (who haven't created any posts). Dividing by zero would result in an error. To handle this, you can use the NULLIF() function to replace zero with NULL, which will then result in a NULL value for avg_like in those cases.

Rounding avg_like: You can use the ROUND() function to round the avg_like to 2 decimal places as requested.

LEFT JOIN for like_agg: You have a small typo in your second LEFT JOIN clause. It should be LEFT JOIN instead of LEFT JOING.

Here's the modified query with these improvements:

SQL

WITH posts_agg AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(post_id) AS post_count 
    FROM Posts
    GROUP BY 1
), 
like_agg AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(like_id) AS like_count 
    FROM likes
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
    users.user_id, 
    name AS user_name,
    ROUND(like_count/NULLIF(post_count, 0), 2) AS avg_like
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts_agg pg ON users.user_id = pg.user_id
LEFT JOIN like_agg lg ON lg.user_id = users.user_id
ORDER BY avg_like DESC;
This refined query addresses potential errors and provides the desired output. Do you see how these small changes improve the accuracy and robustness of your solution?





yes

Great! I'm glad you understand the reasoning behind those modifications.

Now, for our final SQL question, let's delve into a scenario that's a bit more complex and requires some analytical thinking.

Scenario:

The product team is interested in understanding user engagement with posts over time. They want to identify users who show a pattern of increasing engagement. Specifically, they're interested in users who have consistently increased their average likes per post every month.

Task:

Write a SQL query to find users who have increased their average likes per post every month for the last 3 months.

Your output should include:

user_id
name
Assumptions:

Consider a month to be defined from the 1st to the last day of the calendar month (e.g., January 1st to January 31st).
Only consider users who have created at least one post every month for the last 3 months.
This question requires you to think about how to segment the data by month, calculate average likes per post for each month, and then compare these averages across consecutive months. Take your time, break down the problem into smaller steps, and feel free to ask any clarifying questions.

I'm eager to see your approach to solving this!
