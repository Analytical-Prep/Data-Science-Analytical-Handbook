## Foundational Knowledge & Skills

### Statistics & Probability

**What can you expect?** You can expect questions on:

*   Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
*   Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)
*   Hypothesis testing (A/B testing, t-tests, p-values, confidence intervals, statistical power)
*   Regression analysis (linear, logistic)
*   Experimental design
*   Bayes' theorem

**How to prep:**

*   Review fundamental statistical concepts and practice applying them to product scenarios.
*   Focus on understanding p-values, confidence intervals, and how to design and interpret A/B tests.
*   Resources:
    *   *OpenIntro Statistics*
    *   Khan Academy Statistics
    *   StatQuest YouTube channel
    *   Online A/B testing calculators

#### 6. Bayes' Theorem

**Explanation:** Bayes' theorem describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It's expressed as:

P(A|B) = \[P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

*   P(A|B): The probability of A given B (posterior probability).
*   P(B|A): The probability of B given A (likelihood).
*   P(A): The prior probability of A.
*   P(B): The prior probability of B.

Bayes' theorem is used in various applications, including spam filtering, medical diagnosis, and product recommendation systems. It allows us to incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs and update them based on observed data.

**Wikipedia:** [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  Explain Bayes' theorem in your own words and provide a real-world example outside of the ones mentioned above.
2.  A diagnostic test has a 95% accuracy rate (it correctly identifies the disease 95% of the time when it's present and correctly identifies no disease 95% of the time when it's absent). If the prevalence of a disease in the population is 1%, what is the probability that a person actually has the disease if they test positive? (This is a classic Bayes' theorem problem.)
3. A social media platform uses a spam filter. The filter correctly identifies 99% of spam messages. It also incorrectly flags 0.1% of legitimate messages as spam. If 0.5% of all messages are actually spam, what is the probability that a message flagged as spam is truly spam?
