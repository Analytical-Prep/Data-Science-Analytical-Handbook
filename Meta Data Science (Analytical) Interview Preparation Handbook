## Foundational Knowledge & Skills

### Statistics & Probability

**What can you expect?** You can expect questions on:

*   Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
*   Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)
*   Hypothesis testing (A/B testing, t-tests, p-values, confidence intervals, statistical power)
*   Regression analysis (linear, logistic)
*   Experimental design
*   Bayes' theorem

**How to prep:**

*   Review fundamental statistical concepts and practice applying them to product scenarios.
*   Focus on understanding p-values, confidence intervals, and how to design and interpret A/B tests.
*   Resources:
    *   *OpenIntro Statistics*
    *   Khan Academy Statistics
    *   StatQuest YouTube channel
    *   Online A/B testing calculators

### Machine Learning (Focus on Application, not Deep Learning)

**What can you expect?** You can expect questions about:

*   Common machine learning algorithms (linear/logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, clustering)
*   Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)
*   Understanding the trade-offs of different algorithms and choosing the right one for a given problem.
*   Applying ML to product problems like user churn prediction, recommendation systems, or anomaly detection.

**How to prep:**

*   Focus on the practical application of ML algorithms and their interpretation in a business context.
*   Understand the bias-variance trade-off, overfitting/underfitting, and feature engineering.
*   Resources:
    *   *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* (Focus on relevant chapters)
    *   Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course (Coursera)
    *   Scikit-learn documentation

### Product Sense & Business Acumen

**What can you expect?** You can expect questions that assess your ability to:

*   Think strategically about products and define key metrics (KPIs)
*   Analyze user behavior and identify opportunities for improvement
*   Design experiments and translate data insights into actionable product recommendations
*   Analyze a hypothetical product scenario or critique an existing feature

**How to prep:**

*   Practice defining metrics for different products, analyzing user flows, and developing product improvement ideas based on data.
*   Study examples of successful product launches and failures.

    *   Intercom blog
    *   Stratechery blog
    *   Case studies from platforms like Product Hunt

### SQL & Data Manipulation

**What can you expect?** You can expect SQL coding questions that involve:

*   Writing complex queries, joining tables, aggregating data
*   Using window functions and optimizing query performance
*   Analyzing a large dataset or solving a business problem using SQL

**How to prep:**

*   Practice writing SQL queries regularly and focus on efficiency.
*   Be prepared to explain your code and its logic.
*   Resources:
    *   SQLZOO (highly recommended for problems similar to Meta interviews)
    *   HackerRank SQL
    *   LeetCode Database
    *   StrataScratch

### Programming (Python/R - Focus on Data Analysis)

**What can you expect?** While SQL is often the primary focus, you may be asked to demonstrate proficiency in Python or R for data analysis and manipulation. Expect questions involving:

*   Pandas, NumPy, data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
*   Potentially statistical modeling libraries (Statsmodels, scikit-learn)

**How to prep:**

*   Practice using these libraries to perform data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Be comfortable explaining your code and its purpose.
*   Resources:
    *   Pandas documentation
    *   Python Data Science Handbook
    *   Relevant online tutorials

## Interview-Specific Preparation

### Technical Skills Interview

**What can you expect?** This interview focuses on your coding and problem-solving abilities using data. Expect SQL-heavy questions but be prepared to use your preferred language (Python/R).

**How to prep:**

*   Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
*   Focus on problem-solving skills: break down problems into smaller parts and clearly articulate your approach.
*   Practice SQL queries, especially those involving joins, aggregations, and window functions.

### Analytical Execution Interview

**What can you expect?** This interview assesses your ability to conduct quantitative analysis and draw meaningful conclusions.

**How to prep:**

*   Review statistical concepts and practice applying them to business problems.
*   Be prepared to discuss experimental design, A/B testing, and interpreting results.
*   Practice calculating key metrics and understanding their implications.

### Analytical Reasoning Interview

**What can you expect?** This interview focuses on your ability to frame ambiguous product questions, design experiments, and communicate data insights effectively.

**How to prep:**

*   Practice structuring your answers using frameworks like the CIRCLES Method.
*   Focus on clear communication and storytelling with data.
*   Be prepared to discuss the limitations of your analysis and potential biases.

### Behavioral Interview
